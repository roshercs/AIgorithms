# AIgorithms
This repository show my project "AIgortishms (AI algorithms)". As the name say, this project make a web page with HTML5, CSS and a little part of javaScript. The entire project are developtment in Django with Python for backend. It needs some librarys for python as sklearn and others.

This repertoire only include some files of HTML, CSS and Python that incorporates main functionally of the app. For use them, should load them into your Django Proyect in a independent app.
